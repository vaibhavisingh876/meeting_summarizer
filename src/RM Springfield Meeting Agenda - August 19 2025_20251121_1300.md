 Thank you. This is the arm Springfield meeting agenda for August the 19th of 2025, starting at exactly 6pm. I'm Mayor Patrick Tarion calling the meeting to order. All Councillors are present or introduce them. Deputy Mayor Glenn Fuel, Councillors Kazinsky, Miller and Warren are all in front here. I'll go to land acknowledgement there. The arm of Springfield acknowledges that we are gathered on ancestral lands, Treaty 1 territory, traditional territory in Ishtabai, Cree, Oji, Cree, Dakota, Dene, Peoples and on the national homeland of the Red River Métis. We have the agenda that's before us, but there's two corrections to be made on that. The Council should be aware of that through an email earlier today, but we're going to add to the closed meeting a sale of land discussions and the removal of July financial statements. So your agenda may or may not have that, but that's the corrections that we want. Any issues or concerns from Council with regards to the agenda given those changes. I see none. Can I get a move on a seconder for the approval of the agenda, please? Kazinsky and Warren. Can I get a show of hands of those in support of the approval of the agenda with the corrections? It's unanimous and is so carried. Adoption of the minutes, please. That's item number five on our agenda there. A mover and a seconder, please? Tarion and Warren. Any issues or concerns for the Council meetings for July the 15th? I see none. If I can get a show of hands of those in support, please? That is unanimous and is so carried. We will go to item 6.1 that's elected officials reports there. Mover and a seconder, please? Councilor Warren and needs somebody else. Miller. All the reports are there. Any questions? Councilor Miller. Thank you, Mayor. I just have a question on your report. I tried to look through everybody's report, but I had some inquiry on yours specifically, and it had to do with your attendance at the Canada Day celebration, and thank you for doing that and representing us. But the question is, in that line item, it says you met with MLA Schuler, so I'm just inquiring what the meeting was perhaps about, and if it was fruitful, and if there's any movement forward and any, I don't say any commitments, but anything that Council should know in the general public as well from that? No, there is nothing. It's very just meeting there, talking about things, how hot of a day it was. I think we talked about the King Sisters. Kathy came up to us there, so we didn't talk of anything of consequence to Council at all. Just a humorous talk there about the boot toss that was going to be happening at the Egg Festival there, so no, nothing of consequence at all. Thank you for that, and I just have a couple other things to add to my material as well, if that's okay. CYOSILICA, as you know, was in the news because the Broken Head First Nation had a referendum, and that decision was decisive against it, and I was thrilled to see the result of the people of Broken Head First Nation saying that no, as basically a Council, or at least some Councilors here have done, we are anticipating that, at least if the news is correct, that CYOSILICA is going to forward their license back to Manitou Environmental Approvals. They said within the week or so, so I think that was Carla Devlin that was quoted. That's also not only the President of CYOSILICA, but as she acts as the Mayor of the East St. Paul as well, so double duty. So I just want us to be prepared and the people of Manitouba and the people of our community to be prepared that if CYOSILICA comes back to our community, that I'll be prepared to certainly review their file with impunity and justice, but if in any way it's going to affect our water, or if there's not significant differences to it, I will stand tall and I will stand with the people of our community in Southeast Manitouba, to fight for water protection going forward. So please, we need to be as a Council and as an RM fully aware of where their application is in terms of the licensing process. The other thing, two other things I just wanted to mention is this afternoon, the public should know that our Council met, I guess, privately with representatives from the Winnipeg Metropolitan Region now spun to be the Capital Region Planning District and their provincial officials from planning as well, and I think it was a fruitful meeting, but what I wanted to say is that it's important for our residents to know that they are coming together with a plan that's going to be a new plan, not the 2050 plan, but apparently a new revamped plan. I don't know how different it'll be until of course we read it, but that's anticipated or they suggested it would be in the spring of 2026. So for our municipality, we have until October of 2026 to opt out, and there's repercussions, of course, in a whole variety of ways, but what I suggested to them, and as I think other members of Council probably did and probably echo, is that we need to have strong dialogue with the public here in our community as well as throughout the other 18 municipalities. Currently, there's three municipalities that have opted out or in the process of opting out, and I understand there might be more, but as I noted too, I think it's somewhat important to understand the process and see the document of what the promises will be, what the benefits will be for our community. So this is an ongoing thing, but before that plan comes to fruition, we absolutely need to engage with the public to make sure that we're listening and that we're representing them strongly. The final item I have, Councilor, is I've had a number of calls for concerns on Dundee Garson and Zora Road area, and they're very concerned about the road conditions, and I forward that to our CAO, as well as our Public Works Department, but we need to put priority into roadworks and to maintain and to obviously ensure that our roads are not only great, as they have been in the past, but that they don't deteriorate, and I know we've had heavy rains and volatile weather with dryness and all the rest of it, but I think we need to really focus on how we use resources in our RM. So in other words, as many of you know, I'm against going on a Council staff retreat that's going to cost upwards of, I think, $10,000. I think that $10,000, or thereabouts, any thousands of dollars could be put into road repair and or maintenance, and so we need to really sharpen our pencils and put our priorities where our constituents are, not into supporting other rural municipalities in their lodging and their catering and everything else. I think that's a little bit misguided, but that's one opinion out of five, so that's all I want to share. Thank you. Thank you. Just in response to Councillor Miller with regard to CAO Silica, it hasn't changed there, if that's a provincial mandate there. Our statements, I don't we are on record, I should say we are on record as a Council as being neutral for it at the first time with a letter to the CLC saying that we will not condone or whatever the exact verbiage was, but we will not be supporting any mining of the aquifer if it will have a detrimental effect on our water. That's never changed. I myself, with Council's permission, there did answer to two other statements as part of the CLC and just reiterated our concern that we will not be supporting anything unless it's shown to be safe for our water, so that's not changed. I don't know whether it's going to happen next week or whatever you're saying. I haven't heard anything about that, but as for the WMR, yes, we had a meeting at 3.30pm to 5pm today. It was very fruitful, very wholesome discussions there and all our answers were questions to our answers, questions were answered there. We're also having on the 8th of September an open house there. Where is it? An Oak Bank at Baptist Church or the Oak Bank Arena. So on the 8th of September, we're going to have an open house at the Oak Bank Arena there and further than that, oh, I'm sorry, the 9th. And the staff retreat as Councilor Miller stated will be in, I forget where that place is there, but it's an exercise that we did last year. It was very wholesome, it was very fruitful in that we were able to discuss Council budgets going forward there, plus many other issues, so it was very well attended and extremely fruitful for the RM. I just want to discuss Councilor Miller to ask about MLA Schuler. We did meet with our MP Colin Reynolds, the Member of Parliament for Alboot Transcorner Riding, which is essentially from Springfield Road south there, which our new rec center will fall under his mandate for the federal component of that. He was very new at the job, he's never been an MP before, so he was extremely very good discussions with him and our hopefulness that there'll be some more money coming to us at every thing that we're looking to get, and particularly the rec center was part of that. So he's quite good at that. We had met with MP's Falk and Dan Schull, part of that, to another open house that he wasn't able to make soon after the election actually or soon before the election, and we did the same thing with those MP's Falk and Dan Schull. Dan Schull is our new MP, which is north of Springfield and one kilometer to the east there. So that's just open and transparent, and we did a tour of the Dugall Place project with MP Reynolds. I put down here, I don't know if it's really, but I did say that he was a German electrician, which is very nice to see that he's quite capable, red seal there for electrical work, so he was telling us how things are being done there. So that's my report there. Any other questions from Council? I see none, then can I get a show of hands, those in support of the elected officials reports? That is unanimous and so carried. Let's go to 6.2, please. Departmental reports there, mover and a seconder, please. Fuel and Kaczynski. Any issues or concerns from Council with regards to those reports? I just, I have something for public works. I'm not sure if Blaine is on there, if he's not, then something maybe he can address at another time. I'm not sure about the black pipe repairs, he says that they're doing repairs on that. We've had it in there like say 20 years now, is it cost effective there? I've had many discussions with my neighbors who all have the piping there, and so there was issues, concerns with regards to that, but I'm wondering how it is for the taxpayers, are we getting our money's worth out of it, because they are deteriorating and if they have to be replaced at some time. That's just an issue, that's something that maybe our CEO can bring up with Blaine or Mike had another time. And that's about it. Unless there's anything else and I don't see anything, could I get a show of hands, those in support of adopting the DeBart departmental reports, please. Unanimous, so carried.
